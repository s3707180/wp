    <h5>About book</h5>

    <p>In spite of the fact that we think about the world as circular, our primary headings inside it stay 'Down', Across' and 'Up'. These essential bearings stamp the divisions of this anxious book of sonnets, Recurrence, by Graeme Miles. 'Up' and 'Down' in their distinctive courses move outside the human diversion, however 'Over' voyages - Australia, India and Europe – moving around shafts of introduction and confusion, rest and waking.</p>

    <p>Central to the collection are some longer poems and sequences. 'Photis' is a diagonal short fiction, moving some place nearby Apuleius' Golden Ass. 'Verandah' and 'Causes' investigate the hints of individual and aggregate narratives, and the underground underlying foundations of the local and familial. Repeat is an alluring accumulation that rewards a lackadaisical perusing</p><hr></hr>

    <h3>REVIEWS</h3>

    <h4>From Martin Duwell, <a href="http://www.australianpoetryreview.com.au/?s=RECURRENCE&submit=Search">Australian Poetry Review</a>, February 1, 2013:</h4>

    <p>This book gives us an opportunity for a second look at the challenging and sophisticated work of Graeme Miles, his first book, Phosphorescence, having been published in 2006. In one sense nothing has changed: he remains a powerful lyric poet – his poems almost always have enough self-confidence to stay upright as well as walk with their own gait – the exact nature of whose poetic sensibility is very difficult to grasp. The first poem of that first book, “Nest”, is an introduction to at least part of the Miles method:</p>

    <p>The wasps are making a nest on the weight
    of the wind-chime, deaf, I think, to its sound,
    and undisturbed by its sometimes swaying
    for no reason. They build a paper house
    as a launching pad for violence in a calm.</p>

    <p>I’m thinking of a final call, when waiting,
    feeling like the luggage is packed, the phone
    will ring, be answered. The house will be locked
    already and it’ll be time to go.</p>

    <p>The problem for a reader isn’t so much of guessing the intended (and thus structuring) meaning so much as choosing between all the possible meanings since the poem is dense with allegorical possibilities. Somewhere in here is a kind of Frostian poem about the nests that creatures make, usually in inappropriate places, and how humans have to leave such havens. By a further Frostian shift, the “final call” can be read not as the language of airlines but as the final summons of death. The fact that the wasps build “paper” nests suggests that the whole poem might be read as an allegory involving poetry since a poetic career is, in a sense, a “paper house”. The first stanza is full of noise and movement – both of which the wasps are insensitive to – whereas the second stanza, though it is about a noise (the telephone) and a movement (the leaving) is, as a stanza, full of a kind of calm stasis. And that is reading the poem as though it were anonymous; Miles’s poems tend to be full of houses, places stayed in and places left, not to mention places revisited just as they are full of movement.</p>

    <p>When I reviewed Phosphorescence on this site I clung rather desperately to an extended poem, “Circle and Line”, which looked as though it might provide some clues about its author’s views as to what poetry was doing. In retrospect I’m not sure that that was the correct procedure; one ought to able to work out such things by looking carefully at the poems. In Recurrence Miles has gone some way towards mapping at least a part of his poetic by dividing the poems into three sections: “Down”, “Across” and “Up”. It is in the first of these where the significance of the titular direction is least obvious. True, a poem like “Libations”, traces the downward path of water, milk, honey and wine – conscious or unconscious offerings – through the earth to the point where “the only way to go on forever / is to become as small as nothing at all” and “Mineral Veins” explores the way that, in sleep, the self gravitates downwards towards its natural home:</p>

    <pre>
    . . . . .
    Then sleep
    is only half-sleep. Better to turn down,
    find you can breathe easily under a world’s weight
    of earth, and that air was no more your element
    than the endless vacancy it fades to.</pre>

    <p>Gravity, the prevailing god of downwards, is in fact celebrated in a poem of the same name. A large part of the expressive side of Miles’s worldview is made up of mythologies, especially Classical, Norse and Indian, and so it isn’t especially surprising that such a poet should begin with Hesiod’s locating of Heaven, Earth and the Underworld on a vertical axis and then work through the idea of the gravity of an extreme mass as a “Samadhi of space”. The conclusion of the poem also makes a distinctive move, slipping effortlessly from the macro-physical to the inside of the brain: “she’s all herself / fixing and destroying, like the colourless dot / at the beginning of migraine / that grows to swallow the world.”</p>

    <p>Down is allegorised out in other ways too. In “The Problem of Other Minds” (the second poem of a fine sequence with the ambiguous title “Causes”) the movement downwards appears as a pit into which our life experiences are thrown. Again the shifts of this poem are distinctive. The initial image is an interesting one and you can imagine most poets being happy to explore it. Each of us carries a kind of black hole which is being continually stocked by our experiences as they sink into the past:</p>

	<pre>
    . . . . .
    All the toys I could find
    didn’t fill it up. My thin books just lined the bottom.
    Put in my friends and they were small
    down there, craning their necks up
    to see what I’d done to them.

    Put in all the houses I’d lived in, so I wouldn’t
    have to see them again, then left my grave
    with a last house-load of furniture . . .</pre>
    
    <p>But this poem goes on to ask about the pits of others, especially those who have disappeared into the author’s own pit. It is, as its title says, really a poem about the inter-relationship of the experience of subjectivities; we are experiences for others as they are for us. Continually meditating on what we are to others – apart from our usual egoistic obsession with what we are to ourselves – shakes our sense of our own identity. After returning to his own pit (he hears it “slurp as something else fell in”) he sees flecks on the surface spelling out a message, “’What’s it like / to be you?’ And when you looked closer, / ‘Is it like anything?’”</p>

<!--REVIEW 2-->
    <h4>From Ali Jane Smith, <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/lasting-souvenirs-of-the-roads-travelled/story-fn9n8gph-1226597500607">The Australian</a>, March 16, 2013:</h4>

    <p>...A dictionary of mythology (or a search engine) may be handy when reading Graeme Miles's Recurrence, though there are notes to some of the poems at the end of the book.</p>

    <p>Despite Miles's interest in the antique, the book is peppered with moments of recognition: family relationships, friendships, old houses.</p>

    <p>There's a poem describing the feeling that often goes with the contemplation of the celestial, Shivery to think of the long spaces (the title does half the work of the poem), though this poet also describes human experience with a warmth and ease that reassures us that his visits to the dark places of the universe are more a theoretical testing than an existential crisis. Miles has written the best - probably the only - poem I have read about a baby's teething, and then there are lines like these:</p>

    <pre>
    When I put you down
    to bed I hold my face close to yours
    to hear the ascents and descents in wakefulness,
    quickenings and slowings of breath. My head
    beside yours is leonine,
    not with the savagery of hunting, but the rough nuzzle of the pride.</pre>

    <p>It's an old world, the world of Recurrence, a world connected to the past through old stories, generations linked through breath, and the repetition of experience...</p>
