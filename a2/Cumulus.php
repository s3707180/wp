    <h5>About book</h5>
    
    <p>This book is a historic point in Australian verse. For Cumulus, Robert Gray has picked all he wishes to hold from his eight volumes of verse, some of it extensively and fundamentally updated. He has included here another book, 'Anonymous Earth', not already distributed in Australia.</p>

<p>Dim has been a challenging and unique experimenter in the free refrain line, and furthermore on occasion with customary structures. Similarly, his work is striking for its incessant, uncanny rightness in the making of pictures. His reasoning demonstrates a striking familiarity with both Eastern and Western methods of insight (Gray has alluded to himself as a Buddhist apostate). These are all innovator pathways, and this verse arranges them with a clear, traditional temper.</p>

<p>Most striking is an ever-ready promptness—a discernment and brilliance in the liquid minute. Regardless of whether through his exotic dialect or his intense commitment to thoughts, Gray's verse ceaselessly opens us to a new association with the physical world.</p><hr></hr>

	<h5>About Author</h5>
   
    
    <p>Robert Gray was born in 1945 on the north coast of New South Wales. He lives in Sydney, where he has worked in journalism, advertising, as a buyer for bookshops, and more recently as an occasional teacher of literature. Since 1970 he has distributed eight books of verse and six chose releases of his work. For these, he has won the majority of the prizes and artistic honors accessible to a writer in this nation, including the Australia Council's Emeritus Award in 2011. He is additionally the creator of a prize-winning composition diary, The Land I Came Through Last.</p>

<p>When a landscape is sparsely populated, the eye is favored over the ear. Robert Gray spent his childhood in the brilliant coastal spaces of the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, and he has spent his life looking at things, and in searching for the words for them.</p><hr></hr>

    <h3>REVIEWS</h3>
    
	<h4>From Martin Langford,<a href="http://meanjin.com.au/articles/post/cumulus-robert-gray-and-the-visual-arts-of-poetry/"> Meanjin</a>, February 23, 2013:</h4>

<p>When he began writing, in the sixties, he was influenced by East Asian Buddhism. But although he used Buddhism as a means by which to approach the Australian landscape, he was far from being the dilettante of Chinoiserie1 that Laurie Duggan accused him of being. He used the alien tradition as a way of testing what he felt about his own world—as a fresh way of looking at it—and then kept the bits that made sense, much as other writers have done with European or American influences. From the beginning, he zoomed in on—he trusted—some of the less comforting aspects of Asian religion: its lack of sanctuary, its sense of the indifference of the other. One implication of its lack of a hierarchy of powers was that if everything were of equal value, then everything could be of an equal poetic interest. This was not a comfortable place, but there was a liberation in the way it stripped the imagination of its resting places. One could look at whatever one wanted for as long as one liked. It opened up the possibility of a search for the poetry of things.</p>

<p>Although Gray has shown little overt interest in science in his work, there is a convergence in perspective between a Buddhism which invokes the play of the forces of emptiness, and a science whose forces are figured as irruptions of nothing. Because of this, Gray’s world can seem very similar to the scientific one. Ironically, it is also similar to the world of the poets—Duggan, Bolton, Brown—who were his rivals. Where Gray presents a physical world which is ungrounded, Duggan, say, or Bolton, present cultural landscapes which are ungrounded. The members of both camps, moreover, have very visual imaginations, and share a strong interest in painting. Perhaps the difference between the two can best be described in terms of the length of gaze they are habituated to. Gray examines the physical landscape with the slow gaze of an eroticized fascination; poets such as Duggan and Bolton, however, reserve their slower gaze for visual artefacts: at other times, they cast their eyes over the constructed world with that rapidity with which we read the world of signs. The nature of one’s gaze affects one’s attitude to language. If, like Gray, one is a sensualist of the material world, then the shifting nature of language is a side-issue: one’s aim is to focus the mimetic properties of language in order to tease out an exact evocation of one’s experience. If, however, one’s topos is the play of cultural forces, then one will look closely at the unstable nature of language: in this context, linguistic instability is hard to separate from cultural instability. It is as if the two camps just happened to be looking at different things. Easy, for instance, to imagine, at some stage in the early eighties, the Laurie Duggan of ‘New England Ode’ gazing from a pub at the cultural paraphernalia of Armidale mall, while off towards the coast, Robert Gray was gazing from a train at the light on the ranges. Absurd, now, to think that only one of them could be correct.</p>

<p>Gray has been unusually fascinated by the world of things. ‘Things,’ he says, ‘…are worthy of ultimate standing. They’re the location/ of all we know. Nothing duplicitous/ in that vulnerability, we can sense/ they are present entire. It feels these things/ that step through the days with us have the fullness,/ on each occasion, of reality.’(p260) This fascination has been one of the bases of his poetry. Many people would describe themselves as similarly fascinated: they gaze from verandahs, mooch along the shore, check out the sunlight on floorboards. But they don’t give themselves over to it in the way Gray has. It isn’t a calling. Sometimes, good writing can arise out of unusual emphases of attention. If Gray’s has become an important imagination for us, however, it is not simply because he has described material things well. What makes his poetry resonate is the way he has been able to capture that double sense of their hacceity and their indifference. They may be our peers, but they do nothing to lessen our loneliness amongst them. If his work is not a poetry of important narratives, it does come close to being one which defines our contemporary relationship with the material world.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it sounds as if he is trying to find ways for things to speak:</p>

<pre>
Wire coat-hangers,
misshapen, in a hotel wardrobe.
Steamy afternoon sun. (p92)
</pre>

<p>Or they might be tilted into their human moment:</p>

<pre>
Eating watermelon
alone. Seeds taken from
the lips, like hair. (p74)
</pre>

<p>Occasionally, he gives them a symbolic dimension:</p>

<pre>
A late sun
is casting for the fisherman
on the windy river. (p.92)
</pre>

<p>Things, however, still need to be situated. Although they can imply simple ideas powerfully, they cannot speak in a way which allows them to elucidate complexities. How, for instance, might he discuss the nature of the world in which things had their existence? His solution was to create two styles. From time to time, particularly in the early poems—but also, notably, in the later poem, ‘The Drift of Things’7—he has written some of the most overtly philosophical poetry attempted in this country. Some of these poems and passages are essential to an understanding of his œuvre. The following is from ‘Dharma Vehicle’:</p>

<pre>
And there was a Master, Hsuan-chien,
Told his students …
‘There is no transmigration to fear, no
Nirvana to achieve.
Just respond to all things
without getting caught—
Don’t even hold onto your Non-Seeking as right.
There is no other wisdom to attain.’ (p54)</pre>

<p>Gray has a sharp eye for the material world, but in extended meditations such as this, he also displays an unusual ability to articulate abstract thought. One of his most apposite aphorisms, not included in Cumulus, says, ‘One’s touch with things, I have seen, is the same as one’s touch with other people.’ One might adapt that and say it can also be true that ‘one’s touch with abstractions … is the same as one’s touch with material things’. It is a rare thing to be able to use abstractions well: some of those who do it best also have a feel for the sensual world in which abstractions must be grounded. Perhaps because his skill with detail is the obvious thing, Gray has not received enough credit for this.</p>

<!--REVIEW 2-->
	<h4>From Kevin Hart, <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/poet-robert-gray-is-a-master-of-rate-of-change/story-fn9n8gph-1226513587211">The Australian</a>, November 10, 2012:</h4>
    
    <p>TO publish a volume of collected poems is not without risk. It means offering the reading public everything you want to preserve. It's not just a report on what you've written of late but a summa of your vision as a writer, and accordingly it solicits a comprehensive judgment.</p>

<p>Robert Gray's collected poems, Cumulus, is a major achievement, one of the great books of Australian poetry.</p>

<p>What is Gray's vision? At first, the answer seems beguilingly simple: the natural and cultural worlds are all there are. His poetics turn therefore on the senses, especially visual perception, and there is no one else who can see better than Gray.</p>

<p>In an early poem, The Farm Woman Speaks, a woman on the north coast of NSW, who is going through hard times, tells us: "We can't take a bad year, / but the lino looks like an over-ripe banana". The simile tells us exactly how the linoleum is seen, and "but" tells us why it is worn down: there have been many bad seasons before and she has paced the kitchen for hour on hour. We do not simply see through the woman's eyes, we also feel what she sees: a whole world of worry.</p>


<p>For Gray, art is not just attention to what is before our eyes; it presumes a change in the quality of attention. We are invited to see, as though for the first time, what has always been there. To do so, however, requires that we step outside ourselves. In one poem he sees people at the beach: "Racing to the surf / they strike its silver crookedly / as roots of ginger". At first we visualise people entering the cold surf waving their arms and hopping around, their limbs going in all directions like the branches of the ginger rhizome.</p>

<p>Then we feel the gasping of the people in the water: the pungency of ginger. We also notice the allusion to ginger doesn't fit into the economy of the poem; it breaks through the picture plane, and we grasp Gray's point: the world does not neatly accommodate itself to our desires. Finally, we find no "I" in the poem. Gray's vision turns on erasing human subjectivity from art for as long as possible.</p>

<p>Not only from art but also from life: in Dharma Vehicle, a long poem on the development of Ch'an Buddhism from its birth in India to its most radical embodiments in China, Gray quotes Gautama on the self. "I saw the thorn / that is piercing to the heart of men", he says, "and belief in the soul is part of its poison - / the thorn / is one's subjective desire". We must remove that thorn, realise that the self is a tightly constructed fiction, and only then may we live in harmony with nature.</p>

<p>Gray is amused and moved by the deflationary gestures of the great Ch'an sages. Chao-chou, one of the most unconventional masters, is revealed to us, in all his asperity and wisdom, in a short exchange. "A nun asked, 'Would you tell me the truth / that has never been spoken?' " And Chao-chou replied, "Look out, the kettle is getting burned!" The nun has been overly concerned with hearing a marvellous spiritual truth and has missed the deep truth of Buddhism, that we should "just respond to all things / without getting caught".</p>

<p>Yet Gray is no apologist for Buddhism. Although his vision coheres with the "religion of no-religion", and he has no sympathy with the supernatural, he recoils against what he sees as a strain of cruelty in Buddhism. He is drawn to Taoism, and even more, perhaps, to Heraclitus as a corrective to the rigours of religious practice.</p>

<p>For Gray, there is no substance, only change; and for all the sorrows this brings forth, the sole compensation is the immediate presence of nature and, for those drawn to art, the intense pleasure of the sensuous evocation of this presence.</p>

<p>If sometimes Gray's main theme becomes a little didactic, his sympathies expand through the years to include more and more of human experience.</p>

<p>As one goes further into Cumulus one finds poems of deep humanity and compassion that could be written only after years of writing poetry as a spiritual exercise, one that trains the heart to be in tune with the eye. There is the plangent Diptych about his mother and father, and the extraordinary long poem about his mother in extreme old age, In Departing Light. I doubt there has ever been such a powerful and tender poem about the very end of life. "My mother will get lost on the roads after death", he writes, but then consoles himself, "This is all / of your mother, in your arms".</p>

<p>Add to these poems The Life of a Chinese Poet, Bondi, and On a Forestry Trail, among so many others, and we have the mature work of a master.</p>
